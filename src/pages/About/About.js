            Hi, I'm Robert!
            <br />
            <br />
            I'm a full-stack web developer who utilizes my applied physics and
            avionics background to implement agile solutions to complex
            problems.
            <br />
            <br />
            I'm an adaptive and communicative team member that emphasizes
            efficient and readable code. Iâ€™m eager to contribute my skills to a
            collaborative environment where I can further develop acquired
            skills as well as learn new ones!
